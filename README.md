First, pull in the package through Composer.

class User extends Model implements Pointable
{
    use PointableTrait;
}
```

```php
$user = User::first();
$amount = 10; // (Double) Can be a negative value
$message = "The reason for this transaction";

//Optional (if you modify the point_transaction table)
$data = [
    'ref_id' => 'someReferId',
];

$transaction = $user->addPoints($amount,$message,$data);

dd($transaction);
```
